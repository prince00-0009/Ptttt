<p>My Experiences during Sports Fest</p>

It was a significant day for me, we all roared with flaming energy while supporting our players. Even though the weather was burning our skin, we still managed to rise from it. The best part was when the program added songs for us, it felt nostalgic since we couldn't attend this feast for 4 years. What made that day special was the cooperation of our house, it was indeed a splendid time for all of us. That day made me realize that it would be so different next year, some of our manangs and manongs in grade 10 will proceed to senior high school, while us, their lower years would level up in junior high. How thankful I was because we have created bunch of memories that could later on be awed by other people. These experiences will foreverly remain in hearts.
